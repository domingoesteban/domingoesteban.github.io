			I specialize in Robotics and AI, focusing on machine learning for intelligent robot motion and control.
			My work centers on enabling robots to learn, adapt, and move autonomously in complex environments.
		</p>

		<p>
			Currently, I'm a Senior AI &amp; Robotics Engineer at <a href="https://www.anybotics.com" class={linkClass} target="_blank">ANYbotics AG</a>, where I develop AI-driven motion control systems that enable ANYmal to navigate complex terrains.
		</p>

			Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the <a href="https://dls.iit.it/" class={linkClass} target="_blank">Dynamic Legged Systems (DLS) Lab</a> at the <a href="https://www.iit.it/" class={linkClass} target="_blank">Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT)</a>, working on deep reinforcement learning and vision-based locomotion for legged robots.
		</p>

		<p>
			Before that, I completed my PhD in the Learning and Interaction Group at IIT's Department of Advanced Robotics, under the supervision of <a href="https://www.iit.it/people-details/-/people/darwin-caldwell" class={linkClass} target="_blank">Prof. Darwin Caldwell</a> and <a href="https://leonelrozo.weebly.com/" class={linkClass} target="_blank">Dr. Leonel Rozo</a>.
			My research focused on deep reinforcement learning for control, hierarchical reinforcement learning, and behavioral cloning for humanoid robots.
		</p>

		<p>
			I'm passionate about bridging AI and robotics to create smarter, more capable machines.
